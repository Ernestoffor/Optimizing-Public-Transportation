# Optimizing-Public-Transportation
## Description
This project is designed in an assumption of working for the Chicago Transit Authority in their efforts to enhance customer satisfaction. 
The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has asked us to develop a dashboard displaying system status for its commuters. It decided in the project to use Kafka and ecosystem tools like REST Proxy and Kafka Connect to accomplish this task.

Our architecture will look like so:

![Project Architecture](images/diagram.png)


In this project, a streaming event pipeline is constructed around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. Using public data from the [Chicago Transit Authority](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/) an event pipeline constructed around Kafka to allow  simulation and displaying of the status of train lines in real time.

The overarching goal is to monitor a website that watches trains move from one station to another station.

## Prerequisites

The following are required to complete this project:

* Docker
* Python 3.7
* Access to a computer with a minimum of 16gb+ RAM and a 4-core CPU to execute the simulation


### Documentation
The following examples and documentation are helpful in understanding the project design:

* [Confluent Python Client Documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/confluent-kafka-python/#)
* [Confluent Python Client Usage and Examples](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python#usage)
* [REST Proxy API Reference](https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka-rest/api.html#post--topics-(string-topic_name))
* [Kafka Connect JDBC Source Connector Configuration Options](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-jdbc/source-connector/source_config_options.html)

## Directory Layout
The project consists of two main directories, `producers` and `consumers`.

The following directory layout indicates the files that the student is responsible for modifying by adding a `*` indicator. Instructions for what is required are present as comments in each file.

## Running and Testing

To run the simulation, you must first start up the Kafka ecosystem on their machine utilizing Docker Compose.

```%> docker-compose up```

Docker compose will take a 3-5 minutes to start, depending on your hardware. Please be patient and wait for the docker-compose logs to slow down or stop before beginning the simulation.

Once docker-compose is ready, the following services will be available:

| Service | Host URL | Docker URL | Username | Password |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public Transit Status | [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) | n/a | ||
| Landoop Kafka Connect UI | [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084) | http://connect-ui:8084 |
| Landoop Kafka Topics UI | [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085) | http://topics-ui:8085 |
| Landoop Schema Registry UI | [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086) | http://schema-registry-ui:8086 |
| Kafka | PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092,PLAINTEXT://localhost:9093,PLAINTEXT://localhost:9094 | PLAINTEXT://kafka0:9092,PLAINTEXT://kafka1:9093,PLAINTEXT://kafka2:9094 |
| REST Proxy | [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/) | http://rest-proxy:8082/ |
| Schema Registry | [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/ ) | http://schema-registry:8081/ |
| Kafka Connect | [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083) | http://kafka-connect:8083 |
| KSQL | [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) | http://ksql:8088 |
| PostgreSQL | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cta` | `jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/cta` | `cta_admin` | `chicago` |

Note that to access these services from your own machine, you will always use the `Host URL` column.

When configuring services that run within Docker Compose, like **Kafka Connect you must use the Docker URL**. When you configure the JDBC Source Kafka Connector, for example, you will want to use the value from the `Docker URL` column.

### Running the Simulation

There are two pieces to the simulation, the `producer` and `consumer`. Each piece of the code can be run independently to check each component.

However, to run the end-to-end system , it is critical to open a terminal window for each piece and run them at the same time. **If you do not run both the producer and consumer at the same time you will not be able to successfully view the project**.

#### To run the `producer`:

1. `cd producers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python simulation.py`

Once the simulation is running, you may hit `Ctrl+C` at any time to exit.

#### To run the Faust Stream Processing Application:
1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `faust -A faust_stream worker -l info`


#### To run the KSQL Creation Script:
1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python ksql.py`

#### To run the `consumer`:


1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python server.py`

Once the server is running, you may hit `Ctrl+C` at any time to exit.
